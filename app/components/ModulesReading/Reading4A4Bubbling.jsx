                        <p>Using this bubbling strategy for the ACT Reading test will help your performance on the test by doing three things: 1) First, it will prevent costly bubbling mistakes, 2) Second, it will help you work faster, and 3) Third, it will minimize distractions so you can focus on the questions more.</p>

                        <p>For the ACT Reading test, we recommend the following strategy for bubbling:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>First, answer every question for a particular passage before bubbling, which will be 10 questions. Just circle your answers in your test booklet. Even if you skip some questions while working through the passage, make sure every question is eventually answered before you transition to bubbling in your answers.</li>
                            <li>Second, transfer all of your answers for this passage to your bubble sheet, 3-5 at a time. So, in your head, say something like, “Number 4: C, A, B,” and then bubble in C, A, B for numbers 4, 5, and 6 respectively.</li>
                            <li>Third, after you hear the 5-minute warning, bubble after every question you answer, to make sure time doesn’t get called before you’re able to transfer your answers to the bubble sheet.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>By answering all of the questions for one passage first before bubbling, you allow yourself to focus just on answering the questions and not get distracted by focusing your attention on bubbling after every question. Also, when you bubble in 10 answers all at once, you can more easily focus on and keep track of the numbers, to make sure you don’t make any costly bubbling mistakes.</p>

                        <p>This bubbling strategy helps by allowing you to just focus on one thing at a time, instead of doing everything at once. Also, the time you spend bubbling can also be a short rest before you spend your energy on the next passage.</p>
