                            <p>You will almost definitely have trouble finishing the ACT science test in the 35 minutes you are given because the test is designed to be difficult to finish, and this is probably even more true for the science test than for the reading test. The science test is very similar to the reading test in that all of the answers are in the test itself, and the test is primarily designed to test your reading speed and comprehension, just in a slightly different way.</p>

                            <p>Most students do not manage time well for the ACT science test, and so they get a much lower score than what they could have gotten if they simply used the right strategies to manage time. Here are four strategies for managing time for the ACT science test that will help you get a higher score, even without being any better at reading:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>First, and most importantly, make sure you manage time so you are able to get to and attempt every question of every passage. Most students are not able to have time to even get to some of the later passages. To make sure you don’t miss out on any of the later questions that you could easily get correct and thus raise your score, you must force yourself to finish each passage within a certain amount of time, even if it means guessing on a few questions that you haven’t gotten to yet and then coming back to them after you finish.</li>
                                <li>Second, aim to spend an average of about 5 minutes on each passage, closer to 4 minutes for the Data Representation passages, which have 5 questions each, and closer to 6 minutes for the Conflicting Viewpoints passage, which has 7 questions. This adds up to 33 minutes, which gives you 2 minutes of buffer at the end to go back to questions you weren’t sure about.</li>
                                <li>Third, we’ll talk more about this in a later video, but you should skip the Conflicting Viewpoints passage to do last, wherever it shows up in the test. Then, you should aim to finish the first three non-Conflicting Viewpoints passages in about 13 minutes 30 seconds and last three non-Conflicting Viewpoints passages in about 27 minutes. You’ll then spend the next 6-ish minutes on the Conflicting Viewpoints passage.</li>
                                <li>Fourth, again, you must have a digital watch with you if you want to be able to manage time well for the ACT science test. Without one, there is a very good chance you will spend too long on one passage, run out of time, and get a lower score.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>In the next videos, we’ll talk about how to mark two different kinds of questions for the ACT science test: 1) questions you skip, and 2) questions where you’re not sure about your answer, as well as the best way to bubble for the ACT science test. Make sure you watch them!</p>
