                        <p>In this video, we’re going to talk about how you should approach skipping and marking questions for the ACT English test. For the ACT English test, do not skip any questions as you go through the test because you should have enough time to answer all of them, as long as you don’t spend more than 30 seconds on each question, which should be enough time.</p>

                        <p>Although you shouldn’t skip any questions, you should definitely mark down questions where you’re not 100% sure of your answer. However, instead of just circling these questions, which is what most students do, we recommend that you should both circle them, as well as write down their numbers on the first page of the test. This way, you won’t need to waste time flipping through your test booklet trying to find the questions you weren’t sure about. You’ll have all of them in one place.</p>

                        <p>So, at the very beginning of the ACT English test, fold in the corner of the first page, so you can find and flip back to it easily. Then, whenever you come across a question that you answer but aren’t completely sure about your answer, both circle the number in your book and write down the number on this first page of your test.</p>

                        <p>Marking down questions you aren’t sure about in this way is one of the secrets to getting a great score on the ACT English test because this allows you to make the most of your time after you finish the test. Instead of going back over questions you were already confident about, you can spend all of your time only checking over questions that you have a higher chance of changing from a wrong answer to a right answer, which will help maximize your score on the ACT English test.</p>
