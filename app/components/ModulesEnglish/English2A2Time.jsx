                        <p>Most students don’t run out of time on the ACT English test, even though you have to answer 75 questions in 45 minutes, which is more questions per minute than any other test. The reason for this is because each question can be understood and answered relatively quickly.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, going into the ACT English test with a plan for managing time well is still important if you want to make the most of your time and get the highest score possible. Here are two tips for managing your time for the ACT English test:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>First, don’t rush. One of the main reasons why many students get lower scores than what they are capable of is because they rush through the test and make silly mistakes. Silly mistakes are especially easy to make for the English test because many of the choices will look very similar to each other. Make sure you read each question carefully and try to identify the specific rule that the question is testing before you choose your answer. Try to figure out the exact reason why a particular answer is correct, instead of just picking an answer based on your intuition.</li>
                            <li>Second, you technically have 9 minutes per passage. But, let’s take away 45 seconds for bubbling. So, 8 minutes 15 seconds divided by 15 questions for a passage means that you have about 33 seconds per question, or just over half a minute per question. But, we recommend giving yourself at least a few minutes at the end of the English test to go over questions you marked to go over again, which is a strategy we’ll go over in the next video. So, try to answer each question within about 25 seconds, to give yourself that extra buffer at the end of the test.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>In the next videos, we’ll talk about why you shouldn’t skip any questions for the ACT English test and marking questions to come back to after you finish the test, as well as how to bubble most efficiently for the ACT English test. Make sure you watch them!</p>
