                        <p>The ACT Math test is the second test of the ACT. It is 60 minutes long and has 60 questions. The questions generally tend to go from easier to harder, but there will be at least some exceptions to this general rule. The questions are all multiple choice, with five choices. The topics covered are pre-algebra, elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, plane geometry, and trigonometry. There will be the fewest questions on trigonometry (about 3-6 questions).</p>

                        <p>You will probably be more rushed regarding time for the math test than you were for the English test, but if you know your math concepts well, you can still finish with time to spare, which will almost certainly not be the case for the reading and science tests. And because the math test is more challenging than the English test, it is graded more leniently, which means you can miss more questions and still get a pretty good score on it.</p>

                        <p>To get a high score on the ACT Math test, you should be familiar with, and have practiced, all of the major math concepts covered by the test. By following the strategies in this course, as well as by first taking and analyzing smaller sections of real ACT Math practice tests and then building up to the entire test, you will be well on your way to getting a great score on the ACT Math test!</p>
