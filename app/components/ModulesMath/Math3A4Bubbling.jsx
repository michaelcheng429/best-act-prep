                        <p>Using this bubbling strategy for the ACT Math test will help your performance on the test by doing three things: 1) First, it will prevent costly bubbling mistakes, 2) Second, it will help you work faster, and 3) Third, it will minimize distractions so you can focus on the questions more.</p>

                        <p>If you haven’t watched the video on managing time for the ACT Math test, you should watch that one first. For the ACT Math test, we recommend the following strategy for bubbling:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>First, for your first time through the test, answer every question that you are able to answer that you can see with the test booklet open, before bubbling. This usually means two pages of questions, the left and right pages of the test booklet. Just circle your answers in your test booklet.</li>
                            <li>Second, transfer all of your answers on these two pages to your bubble sheet all at once, 1 at a time, keeping track of the numbers. So, in your head, say something like, “Number 13: B” and then bubble in B for 13. We are bubbling in just one at a time because there may have been questions that you skipped, so we don’t want to make a mistake here accidentally.</li>
                            <li>Third, for the second time through the test, or after you hear the 5-minute warning, bubble after every question you answer, both to make sure time doesn’t get called before you are able to transfer all of your answers and because you’re just going to be filling in the gaps from your first time through the test.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>By answering all of the questions that you can see on two pages first before bubbling, you allow yourself to focus just on answering the questions and not get distracted by focusing your attention on bubbling after every question. Also, when you bubble in several answers all at once, you can more easily focus on and keep track of the numbers, to make sure you don’t make any costly bubbling mistakes, which is especially easy to do on the math test, since you will almost certainly be skipping several questions.</p>

                        <p>This bubbling strategy helps by allowing you to just focus on one thing at a time, instead of doing everything at once. Also, the time you spend bubbling can also be a short rest before you spend your energy on the next two pages of questions.</p>
