                        <p>In this video, we’re going to talk about how you should approach skipping and marking questions for the ACT Math test. For the ACT Math test, we’ve already talked about how you should plan to take the test “twice” by first skipping any question you either don’t know how to do or that you think will take a long time to do. Here, we’ll talk about how you should keep track of both questions you skip and questions where you’re not entirely sure of your answer.</p>

                        <p>Similar to our strategy for the English test, we recommend using the first page of the test to keep track of every question you skip or are not sure about. This way, you don’t need to waste time flipping through the test to find these questions. So, right when you start the test, fold in the corner of the first page of the math test so you can find it easily.</p>

                        <p>On this page, you will write down the numbers of questions you skip on the left side and the numbers of questions where you’re not entirely sure of your answer on the right side, like this. Also, circle the numbers of these questions as you go through the test. I would also put a question mark by the numbers of questions where you’re not entirely sure of your answer, so you can easily see which questions you skipped and which ones you’re just not sure about. Then, after you finish the test, you can just flip back to this first page to figure out which questions you need or want to spend more time on.</p>

                        <p>Writing down the numbers of both questions you skip and questions you’re not sure about on the first page of the test in this way is one of the secrets to getting a great score on the ACT Math test because this allows you to make the most of your time after you finish the test. Instead of going back over questions you were already confident about, you can spend all of your time only going over the more important questions, which will help maximize your score on the ACT Math test.</p>
