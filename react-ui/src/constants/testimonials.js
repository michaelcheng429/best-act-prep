After watching (literally all of) your videos, I realized I needed a lot of improvement in time management! I took the ACT again this October and I got a 33. I didn\'t study or buy any prep books - all I did was watch my time more efficiently. I bought a digital watch, began reading the reading passages entirely BEFORE trying the questions, used the finger method in science, and skipped math problems that took too long so I could come back to them later. And I guess you could say these little strategies really paid off. Thanks so much for your videos, I LOVE them. Keep up the good work!!'

I finally got my score back for my second test and studied for a good 2 months straight and watched this video before I took the test again and I kid you not I got a 28!!!!!! I am beyond happy oh my gosh! I thought I would probably go up to maybe a 25 if I was lucky but it went up so much more!!! Thank you for your tips.'
